# learning-git
Learning to code. 
Looking for like minded people to learn from and assist in projects where I can while learning.
Just starting out as a personal interest.
Truck tech by trade who wants to learn about technology.

My goal: 
to learn about everything I can about 
virtualization,  
tech stacks, 
containerization, 
kuberneties, 
writing code, 
programing, 
automation,
machine learning.

The real vision: using my knowledge in trucking industry as class 8 truck tech,
to intergrate IT with heavy rollers for transport logistics.
To push out into the solor system and get some heavy rollers out there to mine the moon, mars, astroid belt

I myself may never see those wheels touch the ground of another planet,
but its not about that its about the future of humanity.
a place, and meaning, purpose for everyone.

This was a test transmission for git-accout.  
Message is honest. 
Thank You.
